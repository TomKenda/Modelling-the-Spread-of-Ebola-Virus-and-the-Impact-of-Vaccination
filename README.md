# Modelling the Spread of Ebola Virus and the Impact of Vaccination

## Abstract

### Context: 

This report on Ebola Virus Diseases (EVD) outbreak is part of the
course of Process-based Modeling in Bioscience Engineering. The overall objective
is to describe all the steps of a modelling process resulting in the creation of a valid
model.

### Methods and objectives: 

We started with the definition of the system and the
identification of the key processes and finish with the evaluation of the performance
of the model. Starting with a literature review of available mechanistic approaches
(including the work of Do and Lee (2016) in Nigeria in 2014 among others) Finally,
we have made a first attempt to predict the impact of the vaccination by extending
the first model. To do so, we used the data available in the external report of the
2019). The model was implemented in Python. All the scripts are available on this
GitHub repository, but the most important one are also listed in the appendices.

### Results: 

The model for the case of Nigeria 2014 was successfully reproduced. The
first equation that was build to model the impact of the vaccination had no significant
impact and was not validated (Eq.5). However, we estimated that public authoritiesâ€™
intervention and vaccination could be modelled by modifying the parameter k in the
equation of the transmission rate B(t) (Eq.6). This last model was successfully
validated on the case of Equateur province in DRC.
